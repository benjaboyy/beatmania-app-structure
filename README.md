# Beatmania Progress Tracker App

Welcome to the Beatmania Progress Tracker App,<br>
A app is designed to enhance your arcade experience by providing a simple way to track your progress and scores in multiple rhythm games which do not support tracking native.
This app is to help you stay organized and motivated while playing older rhythm games.
I have developed this app free and open-source, to provide a tool at first for Beatmania players and i will keep adding titles in the future.

### Key Features:
<ul>
  <li>Progress Tracking: Keep track of your scores, progress and achievements.</li>
  <li>Arcade high scores: Keep track of your high scores in your local arcade.</li>
  <li>Translations: Available in English and Japanese.</li>
</ul>
<p>Set the app to your homescreen or use the website and start tracking your progress in Beatmania!</p>
